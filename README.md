[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/[lengarvey]/[todayiate].png)](https://travis-ci.org/[lengarvey]/[todayiate])

A fun Rails sideproject that I'm building to scratch my own itch.

1. I want to a way to record my meals and remind me if I don't record them.
2. I want a way to share this recording with my personal trainer (or anyone else).
3. I want some open source Rails code up here on Github to prove that I actually know how.
